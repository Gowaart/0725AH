90#VERS#COMMENT##: The auto-tagging was not entirely succesful in this text, needed significant cleaning up. I have done so with regex, but the easiest way to do it resulted in not all names being confined to one line. A lot of them are still on two or more lines and sometimes spread over pages (as is the case in the edition), which perhaps needs to be addressed later on. 
 I deleted editorial sections and footnote markers, tagged poetry (there were a handful of cases of overtagging, i.e. of non-poetry being tagged, which I have deleted, but some may remain). Pagination appears to be correct, though I had to change every PageV06 to PageV05 (volume 6 is made up of indices that are not part of the digital text). There are quite a few empty biographies, these are also empty in the edition.

Annotated and corrected by Gowaart. OCR was largely successful but did skip some lines (or generated only nonsense for some lines), which I have corrected where I spotted it. Annotated according to textual logic as evident from a superficial look. Hierarchy is not self-evident from layout. I have given header status to most words and phrases rendered between brackets which clearly indicate new sections. Most sections separated by an asterisk I have rendered on new paragraphs to break the text into more manageable wholes.
